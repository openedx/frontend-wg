# Frontend Working Group

This is the home of the Open edX Frontend Working Group (FWG).  For more information, see our [page on the Open edX Wiki](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FEDX/pages/3090056949/Frontend+Working+Group).

# Join us

Teach us a little about what's important to you.  Create an Issue in this repository introducing yourself, and answer these questions:

1. What's your background with Open edX?
2. What are your biggest Open edX frontend concerns today?
3. What are you interested in helping with?

# Adding to the backlog

1. Create a Github Issue in this project describing the task.
2. Link it to any relevant documentation or issues in other repositories.
3. Existing members can help move it into the "Backlog" project and assign a milestone where appropriate.
4. Give the Issue an assignee - this is the person who will _champion_ the task and follow up on it to make sure it gets to "Done", not the person doing all the work.

For public work, try to make this task the source of truth.  Especially when linking to Jira or other potentially private task management services.
